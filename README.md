JavaScript quiz game 

## Description 
We are tasked with building a quiz game.  We are using vanilla JavaScript to build a multiple choice quiz game with the goal to store the high scores to be accessed later. The quiz we are building is about coffee and the timer would decrease by 10 seconds every time an answer was marked as incorrect.  We have constructed a five question multiple choice quiz about the other java, coffee and with each click from the user we are logging the correct answer and then showing the next question.  We then have created a separate HTML document to store our high scores.     


## Things I learned 
    -There are many ways to do things using JavaScript and as long as it works, they are not wrong.
    -To make a timer and the questions is easy. The rest of it is hard. 
    -A little bit of styling never hurt anyone. 
    -Why is Finland drinking all that coffee?

This was a very challenging assignment and I know that it could have been less code or looked better, but I did have a fun time making buttons and figuring out how to store the values "on click" helped so much. I am proud of the work that I put into game, and if you learn a little bit about coffee, than I did my job. Thank goodness for frequent pushes to github.  My cat stepped on my keyboard and deleted half the code.
